# Node.js/Express.js RESTful API with SQLite database

Most Node.js REST tutorials use mongodb as a database, sometimes it might usefull to use an sql databse instead, this is a simple RESTful API with SQLite as the database



###### What is implemented: 
- Using middlware in express.js.
- Reading/writing from/to the database with POST and GET.
- Querying the database in an ugly way [prone to sql injection] andÂ a secure way.
